# Machine-Learning

#Repository created with the exclusive intention of sharing my gradual and sometimes painful process of descovery in machine learning, I intend to put every code made, model created and knowlegde that I'm able to absorb here.
Since I'm a newbie in this subject, this repository is gonna be public, all information about the theme is accepted.
Thank you
